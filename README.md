# Soccer-MVP
Most of the winform applications are tied up with code behind which is cool for fast coding but its quite hard for testing. So its always recommended to decouple your business logic so its easy to maintain and also great for testing. 

In this project I have used MVP (Model View Presenter) just like MVC | MVVM patterns where the business logic sits inside the model and presenter controls the data back & forth between model and view. I have used English Premier League score card as an example and sort the score with the minimum difference.

# Abbreviations
